## Biography

I have a PhD in statistical and molecular epidemiology, received in 2021 at Imperial College London.
My background is in statistics, and I have experience in epidemiological research, especially on (but not limited to) neuropsychiatric disorders and cardiometabolic traits.
My main research interests are causal inference and high-dimensional data analysis, and their applications in molecular epidemiology.
